## Getting help

If you have any questions or suggestions, or run into any issues with this demo/template, please let us know, either over in [Github issues](http://github.com/OpenHumans/oh-data-source-template/issues), or at our [Slack channel](http://slackin.openhumans.org) where our growing community hangs out.

## About this repo

### Introduction

This repository is a template for, and working example of an Open Humans data source. If you want to add a data source to Open Humans, we strongly recommend following the steps in this document to work from this template repo.

### Workflow overview

- First get this demo project working. Detailed instructions can be found below, but this involves the following steps:
  - clone this template repo to your own machine
  - set up your local development environment
  - create a project on OH
  - finalise local app setup and remote Heroku deployment
  - try out adding dummy data as a user
- When you have successfully created an Open Humans project and added dummy data using this template, you can start to customise the code to to add your desired data source. This will vary depending on your project needs, but the following hints may help you to get started:
  - the template text in `index.html` can be edited for your specific project, but mostly this file can remain as it is, to enable user authentication
  - data should be added after the user is directed back from Open Humans to `complete.html`
  - we recommend starting by looking at the function `add_data_to_open_humans` in the `tasks.py` file


### How does an Open Humans data source work?

This template is a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)/[Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/) app that enables the end user - an Open Humans member - to add dummy data to an Open Humans project. The user arrives on the landing page (`index.html`), and clicks a button which takes them to Open Humans where they can log in (and create an account if necessary). Once logged in to the Open Humans site, the user clicks another button to authorize this app to add data to their Open Humans account, then they return to this app (to `complete.html`) which notifies them that their data has been added and provides a link to the project summary page in Open Humans.

So let's get that demo working on your machine, and you should be able to complete those steps as a user by running the app, before moving on to edit the code so it adds your custom data source instead of a dummy file.

## Cloning this template

In your terminal, navigate to the folder in which you want to store this repo, and enter the command

`git clone git@github.com:OpenHumans/oh-data-source-template.git`

This should create a new folder named `oh-data-source-template` which contains all the code to create the working demo.

## Setting up local environment

### Installing Heroku CLI

The [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install) is a local command line tool that helps us run and eventually deploy our application to Heroku. To install:

**macOS:**

`brew install heroku/brew/heroku`

**Linux:**

`wget -qO- https://cli-assets.heroku.com/install-ubuntu.sh | sh`

**Windows:**

[Click the link](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install) and choose an installer to download

### Installing RabbitMQ

[RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com) is an open source [message broker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_broker) used by this application.

To install RabbitMQ you can follow [https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html](these instructions), or if you are using a Mac and have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, you can simply type `brew install rabbitmq`, followed by `brew services start rabbitmq`, to set it running in the background. To set it running on very popular Ubuntu and other Debian based systems, it will likely be started for you after you install the package, but can also start it manually with: `sudo rabbitmq-server start`.

### Python

For the current version of this template, you will need [Python 2](https://www.python.org/downloads/). We are working on an updated version to run on Python 3.

Please note that if you are working on a Mac, it is strongly advised that you install a fresh version of Python. The version that ships with OSX is not suitable for development and use with third party packages. Instructions for setting up your Python environment properly in OSX can be found [here](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/).

You will need to ensure that the `python` alias points to a good Python 2 interpreter, and not Python 3 or the default OSX Python 2. First check that Python 2 opens when you type the command `python`. You can change the alias, if necessary, by adding this line `alias python=python2` to your, `.profile`, `.bash_profile`, or `.bashrc` file.

### pip

[pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) is a package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python. It is available [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/). If you are working on a Mac and have followed the above instructions for installing a fresh `Python2`, make sure to use the command `pip2`.

### Virtual environments

Virtual environments are useful when developing apps with lots of dependancies since they enable us to install software locally for a specific project, without it being present globally. Using a virtual environment allows us to use specific versions of each program and/or package for this project only, without affecting the versions that are used elsewhere on your machine.

We will set up the virtual environment here, and then work from within it for the remainder of this guide.

1. install the Python package  [pipenv](http://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), using pip: `pip install pipenv` or `pip2 install pipenv`
2. navigate to your project folder for this template repo, and enter the command `pipenv --python 2.7.14`

This command should output some information about how it's creating a virtual environment for us with some path information about it.

Whenever we use pip or python commands, this virtual environment will be used for the remainder of this tutorial.

### Installing dependencies

You can install all dependancies with:

`pipenv install`

*Note: This will install the dependencies for this project from the Pipfile and Pipfile.lock. If you have issues with installing all of the requirements at once, read the error(s) as there may be some other requirement missing locally (such as Postgres). If you still have problems, [raise an issue on Github](http://github.com/OpenHumans/oh-data-source-template/issues)*.

### Environment file

The environment file contains configurations for running the application, which both `pipenv` and `heroku` will use when running the application. It **should never be committed to git** and should be kept private as it contains secrets.  First copy the contents of the template environment file, `env.example`, paste into a new file, and save with the filename `.env` we will go back and alter the contents after creating a project on the Open Humans site. The `.env` filename should already be in your `.gitignore`, but it is worth double-checking to make sure.

## Creating an Open Humans project

Head to http://openhumans.org/direct-sharing/projects/manage to create an OAuth2 project in Open Humans. If you do not yet have an Open Humans account, you will need to create one first.

1. Click the button to `Create a new OAuth2 data request project`
  ![](https://cl.ly/0J0s3w1y3R2b/Image%202018-02-15%20at%204.53.51%20PM.png) 
2. Fill out the form for your project description. All of this information can be edited later, so don't worry if you aren't sure about it all just yet. However do make sure you fill out the following fields:
    - **Description of data you plan to upload to member accounts** - if you leave this field blank, Open Humans will assume that your project doesn't plan to add data
    - **Enrollment URL** - set this to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`, this should then automatically set the redirect URL to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/complete`

When you have created the project, you'll be able to click on its name in the `project management page` to show its information. From here, get the `activity page`, `client ID`, and `client secret` and set them in your `.env` file. The ID and secret identify and authorize your app. They are used for user authorization and data management.

*Keep your client secret private*, it should not be committed to a repository. In Heroku it will be kept private as an environment variable, and locally it will be available from the `.env` file which should not be committed to git.

## Final steps of app setup

Finally we need to initialize the database and static assets to be able to get the app running. Django will use [SQLite3](http://www.sqlite.org) by default if you do not specify a `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`. For more information on databases you can check out the [Django docs](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/databases).

In the main project directory, run the `migrate` command followed by `collectstatic` as follows:

`pipenv run python manage.py migrate`

`pipenv run python manage.py collectstatic`

*Please note you can ignore the following warning message:*
 > You have requested to collect static files at the destination location as specified in your settings:

 > > development:~/your_project/staticfiles

 > This will overwrite existing files!
   
 > Are you sure you want to do this?


Now we are ready to run the app locally. Enter the command `pipenv run heroku local`, and don't worry if you see the following warning:

 > warnings.warn('Using settings.DEBUG leads to a memory leak, never')

If you are curious, the cause of this warning is outlined [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4806314/disable-django-debugging-for-celery).

Now head over to http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser to see your app running. It should look like this:

![](https://cl.ly/1J3X35170e0s/Image%202018-02-16%20at%202.35.57%20AM.png)

Now you have your application built and running locally, we'll head over to Heroku where the app will be deployed remotely.

If you have hit any problems so far, please do let us know in [Github issues](http://github.com/OpenHumans/oh-data-source-template/issues) or come and chat with us over at our [Slack channel](http://slackin.openhumans.org).

## Heroku deployment

### Heroku setup

If you don't already have a Heroku account, head to http://www.heroku.com/ to create a free account now. If you are new to app development, you may also want to go through their [getting started with Heroku/Python guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#introduction) before continuing with your Open Humans app.

### Creating a Heroku application

Make sure you have installed the [Heroku command line interface](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli), then, from your terminal, you can log in and create your app with the following commands:

`heroku login`

> *you will be asked for your Heroku credentials*

`heroku apps:create your-app-name`

If you use Heroku's free default domain, this will be set by the name you choose here, i.e. you will have

`https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com`

### App configuration

In your browser, head over to http://.dashboard.heroku.com/apps and log in to see the app your just created.

Go to the `resources` tab, and add:

1. `CloudAMQP` - a message queuing service
2. `Heroku Postgres`

Next go to the `settings` tab and add the environment variables as in the `.env` file.

1. `OH_CLIENT_ID`
2. `OH_CLIENT_SECRET`
3. `OH_ACTIVITY_PAGE`
4. `APP_BASE_URL` (e.g. https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com - no trailing dash!)
5. `SECRET_KEY`
6. `DEBUG` = true when needed

Head back over to your terminal and run the following command to initialize and update your code remotely in Heroku:

`git push heroku master`

You can watch logs with the command `heroku logs -t`.

## Adding dummy data

To test out the app as a user, you can add dummy data to your project. First go to the url for your app (https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com), you should see the following page:

![](https://cl.ly/1J3X35170e0s/Image%202018-02-16%20at%202.35.57%20AM.png)

Click the button which will take you to Open Humans where you may have to log in. You should reach a page like this:

![](https://cl.ly/1T2l1w2t2y0t/Image%202018-02-16%20at%202.37.17%20AM.png)

Click the button to authorize the demo app to add data to your Open Humans account. You will be directed back to your app which will complete the data transfer, this should look like this:

![](https://cl.ly/04040F1g2k1X/Image%202018-02-16%20at%202.38.37%20AM.png)

You can then click to return to Open Humans to check that the demo data has been successfully added:

![](https://cl.ly/1r0M1U2d2B1s/Image%202018-02-16%20at%202.40.26%20AM.png)

## Next steps

### Under the hood

Before starting to edit the code in this demo to create your own project, it may be useful to understand what the existing code is doing.

- Upon arrival at the app, the user sees the homepage (the `index.html` file), on this page is a button which transfers the user to Open Humans for authorization
- The user logs in to their Open Humans account, and clicks to authorize the app to add data, this directs them back to the `complete.html` file
- The `complete` function in the file `views.py` receives a code from Open Humans, exchanges it for a token, and uses this token to retrieve the project member ID which is stored in the `OpenHumansMember` model
- As this page is loaded, an automatic, asynchronous data upload to Open Humans is triggered via the method `xfer_to_open_humans`
  - `xfer_to_open_humans` takes the member ID (which was retrieved during authentication over at the Open Humans site), and runs the method `add_data_to_open_humans`
  - `add_data_to_open_humans` runs with three steps:
    - creates a dummy data file, for demo purposes only (using `make_example_datafile` method)
    - deletes any previous files uploaded with this name (using `delete_oh_file_by_name` method)
    - takes the file path, metadata, and user ID, and uploads to Open Humans (using `upload_file_to_oh` method)
  - `upload_file_to_oh` performs the following steps:
    - gets S3 target for storage
    - performs data upload to this target
    - notifies when the upload is complete
    
***A note on asynchronosity***:

*The `celery.py` file sets up asynchronous tasks for the app. The function `xfer_to_open_humans` in `tasks.py` is called (from `complete` function in `views.py`) asynchronously, by the presence of `.delay` in the function call:*

>         xfer_to_open_humans.delay(oh_id=oh_member.oh_id)

*Sometimes uploads can take a long time so we advise using the delay so that this does not prevent the app from processing other events. However if you wish to run your app without asynchronosity, you can simply remove the `.delay` component from this function call.*

## Editing the template

Now you have worked through to create a working demo, and should understand roughly how the demo works, you are ready to customise the code to create your own Open Humans data source. Use the code you have in this repository as a template for your app.

You are likely to want to start making changes in the `tasks.py` file, which is where much of the logic is stored. Intead of generating a dummy data file you will want to think about how to get your own data into the app, whether it is a previously downloaded file, which needs to be processed and/or vetted by the app, or you are working from an external api.

Good luck, and please do [get in touch]((http://github.com/OpenHumans/oh-data-source-template/issues)) to ask questions, give suggestions, or join in with our [community chat](http://slackin.openhumans.org)!
